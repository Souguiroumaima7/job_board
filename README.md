## Features

- User authentication and registration
- View, create, update, and delete job listings
- Responsive UI built with React.js and Next.js
- Backend API using Spring Boot and Spring JPA
- In-memory H2 database for easy testing and development
- Dockerized for seamless deployment

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and optimized web apps.

### Backend
- **Spring Boot**: Java framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Spring JPA**: Simplifies database interactions using Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development and testing purposes.

### Deployment
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application for easy deployment and scalability.

## Architecture

The application follows a microservice architecture where the frontend and backend are separate services. The backend is implemented with Spring Boot, exposing RESTful APIs for managing job listings and user authentication. The frontend is built with Next.js for server-side rendering, ensuring a seamless and fast user experience.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 11+)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (for building the backend)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-board.git
   cd job-board/backend
   ```

2. Build the Spring Boot application:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd job-board/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Interact with the job listings: create, update, delete, or view job posts.
- The backend API can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/api`.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/jobs` - Retrieve all job listings
- `POST /api/jobs` - Create a new job listing
- `GET /api/jobs/{id}` - Get a job listing by ID
- `PUT /api/jobs/{id}` - Update a job listing by ID
- `DELETE /api/jobs/{id}` - Delete a job listing by ID

## Docker Setup

### Build Docker Images

1. Navigate to the root of the project directory and build the Docker images for the backend and frontend:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

### Run Docker Containers

1. Start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

This command will start both the frontend and backend services. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
